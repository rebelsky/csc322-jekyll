Prepare a professional résumé for yourself that you might use to apply
for a job on a team that is developing a medium-scale Web application and
is seeking an intern or new graduate to join their team.  

Note that you are making a *real* résumé for yourself, not one for
someone who is appropriate for such a time.  In particular, the résumé
must accurately reflect your knowledge and accomplishments.

Bring six printed copies of your résumé to class.  We will not have the
resources to print the résumé if you have not printed it in advance and
you will therefore receive a zero on this assignent.
