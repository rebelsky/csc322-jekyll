With the imminent release of the new [ACM Code of
Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org), the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics
(COPE) is hoping to spur the development of teaching materials that
faculty can leverage as they help their students explore the implications
of the code of ethics.  At the center of this effort is a quest of *case
studies* that can serve as the center of discussion.  Right now, that
development is in the preliminary stages.  You can find the initial set
of draft case studies at <https://github.com/kirkpams/ACM-Code>.

Your goal is to write a new case study comparable to those already
in the repository.  However, you have a few additional requirements
that are not in the typical case studies.

1. Identify an "interesting" actual case in the media.  You might explore
issues similar to those in the extant case studies or you might look
at new issues.  I'm particularly interested in case studies that deal
with issues of accessibility, but you should pick a topic that you find
interesting or useful.

2. Write a one-paragraph summary of the actual case, *with citations to
the original sources you've used*.  The summary will appear on the 
second page of the case study.

3. Write a one-page narrative description of a related imagined case 
that allows you to highlight particular issues of interest.  In doing
so, you should reflect on portions of the ACM code of ethics that are
likely to be relevant.  Your narrative should be about the same length
as the extant case studies.

4. Write a dozen or so questions to supplement the basic set of
reflective questions.  The [case on bypassing mobile security](https://github.com/kirkpams/ACM-Code/tree/master/Cases/BypassMobileSecurity) provides a
reasonable set of sample questions.

5. Write a one- or two-paragraph "instructors guide" that discusses the
portions of the ACM code of ethics that you consider most relevant to
this case.

While the repository contains some templates, it is likely those will
be updated.  Hence, you may format these materials as you consider
appropriate.

Send your completed set of answers to me with a subject line of
**[CSC 322 2018S] Ethics Essay/Project**.

I anticipate submitting some of the better cases to ACM COPE for
broader use.  I will ask your permission before doing so.  If you believe
that your case is worthy of submission (and I hope most will be), feel
free to encourage me to submit yours, too.

You may choose to work alone or in a group of two or three students. 
If you choose to work in a group, you should only submit one copy of
the assignment.
