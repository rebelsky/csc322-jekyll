Our goal in this assignment is for you to identify a core set of strengths
you might bring to your project team (and to your other work) as well as
one or two characteristics you might work on improving.

Read the [short list of StrengthsQuest strength themes](http://www.rollins.edu/student-affairs/images-docs/quick-reference-card.pdf).  Then skim the [longer descriptions](https://www.strengthsquest.com/193541/themes-full-description.aspx).  You may, but need not, watch the videos.

Answer the following prompts.

a. Choose the five strength themes that best represent you.  Explain why
you have chosen each one.

b. Choose three strength themes that are, in your case, more likely
weaknesses than strengths.  (That is, what are you least good at?)
Explain why you have chosen each one.

c. Pick one of those three "weaknesses" that you plan to work on this semester.

d. Each team will need a manager/Scrum master, a communicator (e.g.,
to coordinate with the community partner and the alumni mentor), a
lead presenter, and any other roles you may consider important.  Which
role are you best suited for?  Why?
