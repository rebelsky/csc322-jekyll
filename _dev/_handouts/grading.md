The [syllabus](../home/syllabus) summarizes the weights
of various course components.  The [narrative on teaching and
learning](../handouts/teaching) provides some general perspectives on how
I teach, how I hope you learn, and how I grade.  This document provides
a bit more detail on how I will be grading this particular class.

Late assignments
----------------

My experience shows that students who turn in work late learn
significantly less than students who turn material in on time.  (I'm
not sure about cause and effect.)  Hence, I strongly discourage late
assignments.  Unless prior arrangements have been made, assignments are
due at the time stated on the homework assignment.  Late assignments for
this course will receive no more than 75% of the assigned grade.

Because I am concerned about your health and well being, I will waive
the late penalty if (1) you start the assignment at least three days
in advance of the due date; (2) you get to sleep by midnight the night
before the assignment is due; (3) you expend a reasonable amount of
effort to complete the assignment by midnight; (4) you turn in a note
attesting to facts (1), (2), and (3) when the assignment is due; and (5)
you talk to me ASAP about any problems you've had on the assignment.

If you are ill, I will make appropriate accommodations.  Please let me
know as soon as possible if illness will make it difficult for you to
turn in an assignment on time.  (And yes, I realize that it's not
always possible to do so in advance.)

Note that this policy only applies to homework assignments.  It does
not apply to examinations.

Class participation and attendance
----------------------------------

As I suggest in [my statement on teaching and
learning](../handouts/teaching), I don't think you learn the material
as well if you don't participate actively in the class.  I also know
that if you're not here, you can't participate.  Hence, a portion of
your grade is based on attendance.

*Because I do not want you to come to class when you are ill (and likely
to infect others), I excuse most absences due to illness.* I also realize
that there are other exceptional circumstances, such as academic and
athletic responsibilities that call you away from Grinnell.  If you
provide appropriate notification, I am likely to excuse such absences.
However, I do expect you to limit excused absences.

If you miss class for any reason, you are responsible for notifying me.
You may, but need not, specify the reason for the absence.  I would
prefer that you notify me via email before the class period.  If that
is not possible, you should notify me via email by 5 p.m. on the day
that you missed class.  With very few exceptions, I will not excuse an
absence if you do not notify me of within this time frame.  I expect
that you will notify me, even if your absence is unlikely to qualify as
an excused absence.  Absences without notification have greater 
consequence to your grade than absences with notification.

### Expected absences

There are a variety of situations in which students should know early
in the semester that they will be missing classes later in the semester.
Two such situations are sporting events and religious holidays.

Every Grinnell College coach provides his, her, zir, or their players
with a list of expected absences at the beginning of the semester.
I expect you to share that list with me within the first three weeks of
the semester so that we may reach a mutual understanding of how to balance
the requirements of your sport with the requirements of the course.

I encourage students who plan to observe religious holidays that
coincide with class meetings or assignment due dates to consult with
me in the first three weeks of classes so that we may reach a mutual
understanding of how you can meet the terms of your religious observance
and also the requirements for this course.

In other similar situations (that is, situations in which you should
know early in the semester about absences later in the semester), you
should also attempt to provide me with information early in the semester
so that we can reach an appropriate understanding.

Weekly reports
--------------

I expect you to write and present a variety of reports in this course.
Every Friday, you will provide me with an individual time log.  Starting
in week three, every group will also write up a report on their progress.
Groups will present progress reports and demos of their work on Mondays.
I will likely grade these musing my standard plus/check/minus/zero (or
excellent/good/fair/poor) scale, which looks at the big picture and not
niggling details.  But I also like using a detailed rubric that covers
the various aspects of the assignment.

Since different people have different opinions, I thought I should
let you know about my scale.  Work that is primarily correct will
earn you a check (or, sometimes, a "good").   Errors will 
earn you a check minus or minus.  Significant errors may earn you a zero.
Failure to turn the assignment in will earn you a zero.  Particularly
nice work will earn you a check plus or plus.  At the end of the
semester, I will convert the symbols to a letter or numeric grade.
If your grades are mostly checks, you will earn a B on the homework
component of your grade.  Check plus and plus grades will increase
the letter grade.  (Students who earn check plus or plus on at
least 1/4 on the assignments are likely to earn A's on the assignments.)  
Check minus or minus grades will decrease the letter grade.

Team and individual work
------------------------

Your project work will generally be completed as part of a team; the
team will receive one grade for that work.  However, some work for
the course is individual.  That includes any journals, a paper, and
a final portfolio.
