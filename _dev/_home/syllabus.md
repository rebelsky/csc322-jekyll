Welcome to {{ site.courseid }}! The official course description for this
class is:

> Application of software development principles and practices to
a large-scale project. Teams of 3-6 students build software for a
community organization, supported by a faculty adviser and an alumni
technical mentor. Students will gain experience working with a client and
building a substantial code base suitable for inclusion in a professional
portfolio. Students are encouraged to repeat the course for credit
to experience multiple roles within a team and multiple phases of the
software lifecycle.

That is, this course serves as the *practicum* for our software design
curriculum.

Course goals and structure
--------------------------

In this course, you will apply agile software development principles and
practices to a large-scale, ongoing, team project. To motivate and provide
context for the work, projects will serve a community organization. To
provide technical expertise and professional perspective, alumni mentors
will draw upon their practical software development experience.

You will gain experience with the complexities of real-world software
development: communicating with clients; working as part of a team;
self-directed technical learning; creating a substantial project from
scratch, or learning an existing code base; making design decisions
that may have long-term consequences; managing a large code base;
addressing pragmatic and ethical dilemmas. You will be able to draw
upon these experiences in pursuing academic or industry positions. By
sharing your source code through GitHub, you will make a substantial
beginning or addition to your professional portfolio. You will develop
professional skills and perspectives.

This course is a companion to CSC 321, Software Development Principles
and Practices. In CSC 321, you will learn how to apply agile software
methodology to developing software as a service (SaaS) using the Ruby
on Rails framework. In this course, you will apply what you learned to
a large-scale, real-world project.

Accommodations and adjustments
------------------------------

Please read [my policy on accommodations and adjustments]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/accommodations) and [my statement on accessibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/accessibility).

Weekly structure and workload
-----------------------------

After a two-week period in which we set up the context of the projects, the 
course is structured in a sequence of two-seek sprints.  The in-class time
for each sprint is generally organized as follows.  (In the second half
of the semester, the second hour of class will be work time.)

* Monday: *Presentations*.  Groups present on some aspect of their project.
    * First week: *Sprint retrospective and planning*.  Each group gives
      a short report on the past sprint and their plans for the current
      sprint.
    * Second week: *Demos and check-ins*.  Each group gives a short
      demo of some aspect of the current state of the system.  I do a
      mid-sprint check-in with each group.
* Wednesday: *Work time*.  Teams may work on the project, meet
  with their community partners, meet with their alumni mentors, get help
  from the instructor or mentor, or any combination thereof.
* Friday: *Discussion*.  We will discuss some topic related
  to the course.  The primary themes for Fridays are computer ethics and
  object-oriented design.

The course meets three hours per week for the first half of the semester
and six hours per week for the second half of the semester.  You should
plan on about two hours of out-of-class work each week.  Grinnell's
[semester credit definition](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrar/Shared%20Documents/semester%20credit%20definition%20RESOLUTION.pdf) indicates
that a two-credit course should require a minimum of 90 hours of work.
seven weeks of five hours and seven weeks of eight hours is 91 hours.

Important Warnings
------------------

*Warning!*  This course exercises some different skills than other
CS courses.  You will need to work with other people on your team
as well as clients from outside Grinnell.  You will have to manage
your own time and arrangements.  

*Warning!*  Students report that the workload in CSC 322 can easily 
become more than is appropriate for a 2-credit course, particularly
since they find value in the work they are doing.  I will do my best
to give you credit for time spent on work (provided it is well documented)
rather than just particular outcomes.

*Warning!* Both the course and the platform are new to me.  Expect me
to be even less organized than normal.

Grading
-------

My goal is for everyone taking this course to be able to demonstrate
familiarity, fluency, and excellence with the course concepts. I would be
very happy if you all met the goals above and received "A"s. The following
weighting of individual activities will provide a basis for evaluation.

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Attendance</dt>
  <dd>Penalty only</dd>
  
  <dt>Participation</dt>
  <dd>5%</dd>

  <dt>Reading journals and homework assignments</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>

  <dt>Weekly individual and group reports</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>
  
  <dt>Weekly presentations</td>
  <dd>10%</dd>

  <dt>Public presentation</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>

  <dd>20%</dd>
  
  <dt>Portfolio</dt>
  <dd>15%</dd>
  
  <dt>Paper</dt>
  <dd>20%</dd>
</dl>

Some work may be graded by someone other than the instructor. However,
any questions or concerns about grading should only be directed to
the instructor.

The grading scale for this course will be:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>A</dt> <dd>94&ndash;100%</dd>
  <dt>A-</dt><dd>90&ndash;93%</dd>
  <dt>B+</dt><dd>87&ndash;89%</dd>
  <dt>B</dt> <dd>84&ndash;86%</dd>
  <dt>B-</dt><dd>80&ndash;83%</dd>
  <dt>C+</dt><dd>77&ndash;79%</dd>
  <dt>C</dt> <dd>74&ndash;76%</dd>
  <dt>D</dt> <dd>60&ndash;69%</dd>
  <dt>F</dt> <dd>0&ndash;60%</dd>
</dl>

You may note that there are some gaps between ranges.  I reserve the
right to make decisions about which direction to "round" values in
those gaps. I also reserve the right to adjust this scale during the
semester. You will be notified of any changes, and the scale will not
change in the final two weeks of the course. You may ask me for your
current grade in the class at any point; I will happily give you my best
estimate based on the current scale and graded work so far, but *these
estimates are not guarantees of a specific final grade*.

Attendance
----------

Your classmates and partners depend on your contributions to learn new
material and complete the required work for this course. *Don't let them
down!* I expect you to arrive on time and actively participate in
every class.

Because your participation is so important, I will not grant excused
absences except in particular and exceptional circumstances. I will
deduct 2% from your final grade for each absence in the first half of
the semester, 4% from our final grade for each absence in the seocnd
half of the semester, and 1% for each time you are between five and
fifteen minutes late to class. These deductions are doubled if you do
not send me a short note on the day of the absence or late attendance,
preferably in advance (e.g., "I will be unable to make it to class today"
or "I apologize for missing class today" or "Another instructor has asked
that I meet with them immediately after class; I expect that I'll be
about ten minutes late.")  I allot each student a 4% "penalty buffer,"
so you may miss two classes (if you send notes), miss one class (if
you fail to send a note), or arrive late four times (if you send notes)
with no impact on your final grade.  This policy is intended to give you
the flexibility to deal with or personal or other issues (including job
interviews) that require you to miss class.

I realize that there are a number of reasonable and expected absences.
These include athletic events, academic conferences, course trips,
and religious observations.  Such absences do not count as unexecused
absences provided you notify me of them at least one week in advance.

If you are ill, I would prefer that you rest and get better rather than
attend class.  

I realize that some disabilities may require you to miss class.  Ideally,
these requirements are documented in your accommodations form.  But I
will do my best to make adjustments and accommodations in all cases.

If your are sick, *please do not come to class.*  I
would prefer that you reset and get better.  Please seek
medical care as needed. [Student Health and Counseling Services
(SHACS)](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/student-health)
offers health and mental health services to students.  I excuse illness
provided you notify me the day of class, preferably in advance of class.
I do not require a note from SHACS or your doctor.  Note, however, if
you are ill more than a few times, I may discuss the issue with student
affairs and may stop excusing illness-based absences.

Participation
-------------

Because much of our work in this course involves collaboration and discussion, you will be evaluated on your participation.
Participating in class involves:

 - being present in class (physically and mentally)
 - coming to class on time
 - coming to class prepared
 - asking questions when appropriate
 - making positive contributions to class discussion by volunteering and when called upon
 - staying on task during lab exercises, and
 - working effectively with your partner(s)

Students who regularly meet these criteria can expect to earn an A- for their participation grade. I will reward students who regularly provide significant insights or guide discussion in productive ways with a higher participation score. Students who fail to participate regularly (e.g., demonstrating a lack of preparation or involvement during lab exercises) or who participate in counterproductive ways (e.g., by dominating the conversation, making inappropriate comments, or getting off-task) can expect to earn a lower score.

Academic honesty
----------------

Please read [my policies on academic honesty]({{ site.baseurl
}}/handouts/academic-honesty) and [the CS department's academic honesty
policy](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy).  I expect
you to sign and return the latter.

Extra credit
------------

Although I regularly offer extra credit in my four-credit courses, I do
not offer extra credit in two-credit courses.  Nonetheless, I will still
recommend academic, artistic, cultural, and peer events on campus.

Citations
---------

I developed much of this course and the corresponding syllabus using
Janet Davis's resources.  I think her for her careful development of
the course and her willingness to allow me to reuse her resources.

Much of the original site design comes from Charlie Curtsinger.
