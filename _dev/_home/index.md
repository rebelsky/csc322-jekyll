## About this course

Welcome to the Spring 2017 section of Grinnell College's CSC 322, *Team Software
Development for Community Organizations*.  CSC 322 is an opportunity for
you to apply the ideas and tools you learned in CSC 321 and elsewhere in
our curriculum to real-world problems.  In particular, in CSC 322 we build
software projects that support organizations in our local community.  This
semester we will be working on a wide variety of projects.

Past history suggests that because most students are learning Rails and
Ruby during the first half of the semester, the course ends up somewhat
back focused.  To address that issue, we will be having three one-hour
meetings each week for the first half of the semester, and three two-hour
meetings each week for the second half of the semester.  This approach
gives you the opportunity to "ramp up" in how you work on the material.
In the second half of the semester, almost all of your work for the class
happens during class time.
