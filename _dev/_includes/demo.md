Plan a demo that is approximately five minutes long and that shows off
some interesting aspect of the current state of your system, preferably
some issue related to the previous or current sprint.  For example, you
might show a feature that you just completed or a bug that you intend
to fix.

Your presentation should be professional.  Among other things, you should
know how to connect your computer to the projector and you should have
rehearsed and attempted any steps you plan to present.

Be ready for questions!  And be ready to ask questions about other groups'
demonstrations.
