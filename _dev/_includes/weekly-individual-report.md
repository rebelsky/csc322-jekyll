This semester, I am requiring weekly individual reports to encourage
you to think more carefully about how you are spending your time in
this class, how long some tasks take, and what you are learning from 
the various activities. 

Send a short report to your instructor.  Your report should be titled
"**{{ site.courseid }} {{ site.semester }} {{ page.title }} (*Your
Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and should include the following.

* A short log of what you did during the "unscheduled" time you worked in
  this class (i.e., the in-class time designated as "work time" and the 
  out-of-class time).
* Something positive about that work.  (I realize that it may sometimes
  be a stretch to take something positive out of a frustrating week.
  Try.)
* Something you've learned from that work.

For example,

    2018-02-04, 15:00--15:15
      Met with team.  Decided on a new distribution of labor.
      Looked at the Git repo together.
    2018-02-04, 15:15--15:30
      Read over AB's pull request, discussed one complexity,
      and pulled their changes into our main repository.
    2018-02-04, 15:30--15:50
      Read the documentation for the routes DSL, available at
      <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html>
    ...

    Positive: This was the first time that I'd worked with someone
    else's pull request in Git.  I found that the use of pull requests,
    rather than pushing directly to the repository, encouraged me to
    look at the code that was being added and gave AB and me a chance
    to consider some bigger-picture issues.

    Learned: I learned a bit more about routes.  One cool thing I learned
    is how to figure out which routes are currently mapped, which you
    can do by giving an invalid URL.  I wonder if that's a security
    hole.
