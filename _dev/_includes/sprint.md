You have just finished one sprint and are about to embark on the next
sprint.  In a normal work situation, you would likely meet with your
clients and Scrummaster.  You would do a retrospective assessment on
your past sprint and plan for your forthcoming sprint.

Since this is a class situation, we take a slightly different approach.
We ask each team to give a short (under seven minute) presentation in
which they retrospect on the prior sprint and describe their plans for
the coming sprint.  (The team should have made those plans in advance.)

Your presentation should include the following.

* A summary of the work you completed (and did not complete) in the
  previous sprint.
* An estimate of your velocity.  This should not be hard to compute
  if you've documented and kept track of your tasks well.
* Your plans for the coming sprint.  You should list the tasks, their
  associated user stories and the point values
  that you've assigned to those tasks.  (Not all task will have
  an associated user story, but most should.  All tasks should have
  an associated point value.)
* Comments about any resources you need for the coming sprint or
  obstacles that are of concern.

You should anticipate questions.  You should also be prepared to ask
questions of your colleagues.
