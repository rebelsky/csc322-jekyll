### News / Etc.

* Please let me know when you notice problems on the Web site.  I think 
  I've fixed most of them.  (Okay, something is massively wrong with the
  generation of readings in the schedule, but that turns out to be a programming
  problem I don't have time to address.)
* Don't forget to keep up with clients and getting your projects in order!
  You should be writing user stories.
