### News / Etc.

* Our mentors arrive next Tuesday.   Plan to meet with them at lunch (and
  at 11, if possible and probably for a Tuesday CS extras).

### Upcoming Work

* Paper: Approx. 1000 words.  Reflect on the
  [the new draft ACM code of
  ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/2018-code-draft-2/).  Compare to the
  old version.  What changes do you see as particularly important?
  What other changes do you think should still be made?  What else
  belongs?  What doesn't belong?  Etc.

### Good things to do
