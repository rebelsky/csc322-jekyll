### News / Etc.

* Welcome back from break!   I hope that you had a good one.
* We have a new format for class now that it's the second half
  of the semester.

### Upcoming Work

* Paper: Comparatively reflect on the [the new draft ACM code of
  ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/2018-code-draft-2/).  
    * E.g., What changes do you see as particularly important?
      What other changes do you think should still be made?  What else
      belongs?  What doesn't belong?  Etc.
    * Approximately 1000 words.  Correct grammar and spelling.  I may
      invoke the MC/JS rule if there are multiple problems with grammar
      or spelling.

* Regular work on projects.

    > Bots are small automated programs that index websites, edit Wikipedia entries, spam users, scrape data from pages, launch denial of service attacks, and other assorted activities, both mundane and nefarious. On Twitter bots are mostlyspam, but occasionally, theyâ€™re creative endeavors.  Mark Sample will lead participants in the creation of bots that can "reveal the injustice and inequality of the world and imagine alternatives. ... that question how, when, who and why."
