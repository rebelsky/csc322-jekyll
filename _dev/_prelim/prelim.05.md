### Admin

* Our goal for today is to help build teams.

### Upcoming work

* Make an appointment to meet with your community partner.  Contact
  Susan Sanning if you need contact info.  Plan to meet with your
  community partner some time next week, if possible.
* If you are working on an existing project, find it in the CSC 322
  repository, make a clone, and try to get it running.
* If you are working on a new project, get it set up in the CSC 322
  repository.  (A blank Rails thing is fine.)

### Good things to do

* Rosenfield symposium, this week.  (Lots of different events)

#### Misc

* Les Duke
* Sign up for picnic
