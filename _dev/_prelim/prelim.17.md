### News / Etc.

* I'll do a quick check-in with each group to hear your plans for the
  week.  The rest of the morning is yours.  The mentors and I will be
  available to answer questions.

### Upcoming Work

* Paper: Comparatively reflect on the [the new draft ACM code of
  ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/2018-code-draft-2/).  
    * E.g., What changes do you see as particularly important?
      What other changes do you think should still be made?  What else
      belongs?  What doesn't belong?  Etc.
    * Compare to the prior ACM code of ethics.
    * Approximately 1000 words.  Correct grammar and spelling.  I may
      invoke the MC/JS rule if there are multiple problems with grammar
      or spelling.
    * Due via email at 10:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 2
* Regular work on projects.
* Weekly Project Report, Friday at 5pm
    * What did you accomplish this past week?
    * What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
    * What obstacles stand in your way?
    * What resources do you need to help you accomplish your work?
* For Tuesday: Read Chapter 3 of POODR.  (Read Chapters 1 and 2 if you
  have not read them already.)
