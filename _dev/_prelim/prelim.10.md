### News / Etc.

* Please let me know when you notice problems on the Web site.  I think 
  I've fixed most of them.  (Okay, something is massively wrong with the
  generation of readings in the schedule, but that turns out to be a programming
  problem I don't have time to address.)

### Upcoming Work

* More readings for Thursday.  See schedule.

### Good things to do

_Note: I do not do extra credit in two-credit classes._

#### Academic

* The various Google activities.

#### Misc.

* Volleyball Wednesday night
* GHS Homecoming Parade Thursday night
