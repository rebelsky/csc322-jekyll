### Admin

* Welcome back!  I think I know most of you (at least from CSC 321), and I'm
  happy to be able to work with you again.
* I will take attendance.  (Who is in this class but not in 321?)
* Warning!  As is too often the case, the Web site for this course is not yet
  ready for prime time.

### Upcoming work

* Refresh your knowledge of Ruby by doing <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-ruby-intro>.

    * Those in CSC 321 will be doing those problems as part of the first
      homework in CSC 321.
