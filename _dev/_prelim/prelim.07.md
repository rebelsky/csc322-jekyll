### News / Etc.

* Don't be afraid to ask for help!  (From me, from your classmates, from
  Adam, from the Interweb.)
* Office supplies in the commons.  Free will donations.
* Please let me know ASAP if you notice things missing from the Web site.
  I'm still getting up to speed on Jekyll; this course suffers the most.
* Yes, you can schedule meetings with clients (and, soon, with mentors) 
  during class time (other than Mondays).  Just give me advance notice
  so that I can schedule other issues appropriately.
* Class time Wednesday will be spent on meeting with clients or just
  working as teams on user stories.
* Friday will be more ethics.
