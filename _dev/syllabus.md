Learning Goals
--------------

Our major objectives for this course include:

  - Something
  - Something else

Important Notices
-----------------

 - Computers have no common sense or compassion. They are complex, and sometimes they do things we don't expect. When things go wrong, don't blame yourself. Ask your instructor, your mentor, or a tutor for help.
 - I am moving to a new site development system this semester.  Expect things to be wonky for awhile.
 - As always, I am overcommitted.  I apologize in advance.

Grading
-------

My goal is for everyone taking this course to be able to demonstrate
familiarity, fluency, and excellence with the course concepts. I would be
very happy if you all met the goals above and received "A"s. The following
weighting of individual activities will provide a basis for evaluation.

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Attendance</dt>
  <dd>Penalty only</dd>
  
  <dt>Participation</dt>
  <dd>5%</dd>
  
  <dt>Labs</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>
  
  <dt>Assignments</dt>
  <dd>15%</dd>
  
  <dt>Project</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>
  
  <dt>Quizzes</dt>
  <dd>10%</dd>
  
  <dt>Exams</dt>
  <dd>40%</dd>
  
  <dt>Best</dt>
  <dd>10% <i>(best of homework, quizzes, or exams)</i></dd>
</dl>

Some work may be graded by someone other than the instructor. However, any questions or concerns about grading should only be directed to the instructor.

The grading scale for this course will be:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>A</dt> <dd>94&ndash;100%</dd>
  <dt>A-</dt><dd>90&ndash;93%</dd>
  <dt>B+</dt><dd>87&ndash;89%</dd>
  <dt>B</dt> <dd>84&ndash;87%</dd>
  <dt>B-</dt><dd>80&ndash;83%</dd>
  <dt>C+</dt><dd>77&ndash;79%</dd>
  <dt>C</dt> <dd>74&ndash;77%</dd>
  <dt>D</dt> <dd>60&ndash;69%</dd>
  <dt>F</dt> <dd>0&ndash;60%</dd>
</dl>

You may note that there are some gaps between ranges.  I reserve the right to make decisions about which direction to "round" values in those gaps. I also reserve the right to adjust this scale during the semester. You will be notified of any changes, and the scale will not change in the final two weeks of the course. You may ask me for your current grade in the class at any point; I will happily give you my best estimate based on the current scale and graded work so far, but *these estimates are not guarantees of a specific final grade*.

Attendance
----------

Your classmates and partners depend on your contributions to learn new material and complete the required work for this course. *Don't let them down!* You are expected to arrive on time and actively participate in every class.

Because your participation is so important, I will not grant excused absences except in exceptional circumstances. I will deduct 1% from your final grade for each absence and 0.5% for each time you are late to class. However, each student is allotted a 2% "penalty buffer," so you may miss two classes or arrive late four times with no impact on your final grade.  This policy is intended to give you the flexibility to deal with brief illnesses or personal issues that require you to miss class.

If you need to miss more than two class periods for an exceptional reason (e.g. to attend an academic conference, deal with a family emergency, or due to long-term illness) please talk to me as soon as possible and we will make an alternate arrangement.

If your are sick, *please do not come to class.* Stay in your room, rest, and seek medical care as needed. [Student Health and Counciling Services (SHACS)](http://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/student-health) offers health and mental health services to students.

Participation
-------------

Because much of our work in this course involves collaboration and discussion, you will be evaluated on your participation.
Participating in class involves:

 - being present in class (physically and mentally)
 - coming to class on time
 - coming to class prepared
 - asking questions when appropriate
 - making positive contributions to class discussion by volunteering and when called upon
 - staying on task during lab exercises, and
 - working effectively with your partner(s)

Students who regularly meet these criteria can expect to earn an A- for their participation grade. I will reward students who regularly provide significant insights or guide discussion in productive ways with a higher participation score. Students who fail to participate regularly (e.g., demonstrating a lack of preparation or involvement during lab exercises) or who participate in counterproductive ways (e.g., by dominating the conversation, making inappropriate comments, or getting off-task) can expect to earn a lower score.

Academic Honesty
----------------

Please read [my policies on academic honesty]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/academic-honesty) and [the CS department's academic honesty policy](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy).  I expect you to sign and return the latter.
