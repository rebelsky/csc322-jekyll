Preliminaries
-------------

### Notes and news

* Alumni mentors visit next Wednesday.  Please try to clear lunch time,
  4pm for their talk, (and 1pm and 2pm, if possible).
* We'll have a design thinking workshop on Monday.

### Upcoming work

* Weekly reports TODAY
    * [Individual](../reports/individual-report-week-03)
    * [Team](../reports/team-report-week-03)
* No current homework.  Work on your projects.

### Good things to do: Academic

* Megan Goering talk Tuesday
* CS Mentor talk Wednesday

### Good things to do: Miscellaneous

### Friday PSA

### Questions

About the alumni mentors
------------------------

* Bring in people who understand the ins and outs of building software
  for real people to serve as advisors.
* Rails in practice is different than rails in theory.  They can
  help bridget the gap.
* This course is partially about professional development.
  Interacting with these folks is PD.  You can also ask them
  for advice.
* Initiative for "Alumni in the classroom"
* Alums really do care.
* This class is about soft skills
    * A team
    * A non-technical client
    * A (distant) leader (not on site)
    * One clueless high-level supervisor (pointy haired boss)

Object-oriented design fundamentals
-----------------------------------

We teach you that OOD exists to help make better software.

* Remove dependencies between parts.
* Keep code DRY

OOD helps

* Encapsulation reduces dependencies
* Inheritance reduces code duplication
* Polymorphism reduces code duplcation
     * Subtype polymorphism: Reduce duplication of procedures
     * Parametric polymorphism: Reduce duplcation of data structures

Multiple models
---------------

* Different views on inheritance.
    * Single inheritance vs. multiple inheritance
    * Class inheritance vs Object inheritance
        * Normal mechanism: Make a new object, change some property
* Different views on typing
    * Static
    * Duck

Broadening our perspective
--------------------------

* Designing software for reuse
* Planning for the future
* Using more tools than just encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
    * Design patterns
    * Way too many principles, most of whose names I forget

Learning OO thought processes
-----------------------------

* Bad: Contrived examples.
* Good: Real example, developed from practice.
    * Happens on real projects
* Acceptable: Carefully designed examples based on realistic project
    * Start with code you *might* have written.
    * Look at ways to improve it.
* You best understand concepts when you apply them (or fail to
  apply them) (or encounter them)
* Even if I ask bad questions, spend time with Metz.
    * Read the code
    * Pay attention to the changes
    * Try to understand what the changes mean.
