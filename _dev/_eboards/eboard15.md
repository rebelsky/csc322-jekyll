### Good things to do

_Note: I do not do extra credit in two-credit classes._

* CS Extras Today visitor from UIowa

### Questions

Group reports
-------------

### Local Foods

* We got a detailed overview of what our Web architecture should be.
  Where do we store data and how to refer to those data in the 
  different parts of the Web applications.
* We'll be using Rails for the data with an API.
* The feature in the main Web site will probably be Javascript based.
* Communication: Slack etc.

### Mayflower

* Talked about where images should reside
* Prioritized tasks on Trello
* Plan to talk on Monday evenings
* Looked at some design issues
* Some advice on history

### GPCF

* How do you deal with inherited code?  Advice: Don't need to
  grow comfortable with the whole system, just the sections with
  bugs.  Work from there.
* Bugs include: Create events without login, no login for community
  partners, calendar wonkiness
* Strategies for delegation.  How best to organize pairs.  Do you do
  two novices, or one experienced and one novice.  
* Communication via email.

### PALS

* Plan to communicate once per week on Tuesdays (not the first week).
* Some useful gems to help them get there.
* Setting up Trello well.
* New focus: Community board.  (Registering, preferences, etc.)
* Make sure to use a production database for your production deploy.
* Team contract really useful.  Sam should ask Cassie for a copy.

### Heartland

* Probably meeting with their partner.

### Side discussion: SQL implementations

* There are lots of SQL implementations.  How do they differ?
* Same basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, ...)
* Important difference: Support for transactions.  Transactions are
  collections of instructions that either all succeed or all fail.
* Important difference: Footprint (CPU, resources, etc.).
* Important difference: Robustness for production.
* We use SQLlite during development but PostgreSQL for deployment.
* Difference: Most SQL implementations include another associated programming
  language.  Those differ significantly.

Team Contract
-------------

Objectives

* All team members will understand responsibilities and expectations.
* Decisions are more efficient with a shared understand of roles
* Meetings are more efficient with a shared understanding of roles

Roles

* What are you doing.
* Able to say: "That's a task for X"
* Talk about strengths and weaknesses.

Schedule Information / Flexibility

* When will you be gone / busy

Communincation policies

* When you meet

Strengths

Other things

* What are your desired areas of growth?

Tools

* Project
* Communication
* Etc.

Note

* Also gives you good things to check in on.

Diving into Trello
------------------

* Making it clear what the status of different tasks is
    * Done
    * Future
    * Working on
    * Waiting for acceptance fromt he client
* Making it clear who is doing the different tasks
* Also allocating tasks: Some are dependent, some are independent.
  Need to note dependencies.  Need to have some independent tasks so
  that you're not stuck waiting on others.
* Label with priority marker
* Label with expected cost (and maybe actual cost)

Optimizing Use of Mentors
-------------------------

* When should you meet them (online, in person)?
* In person week five or so.
* Soon after meeting with client, when we are setting up our project
  (or trying to figure out how to get the current version of the project
  up and running).
* NOT midsems week.
* Mentors are useful for thinking about team building and other issues,
  get them on board early.
