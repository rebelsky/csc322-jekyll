### Questions

_Who is this Vivek Venugopal '01 character, anyway?_

> Vivek Venugopal â€™01 (Computer Science) is the co-founder of Qwill. After a few years as a software developer immediately after college, Vivek decided to take his career in a different direction and went into non-profit fundraising. That career moved him to San Francisco where he decided to jump onto the tech wave. In 2017, he left LinkedIn to start a new venture, Qwill, of which he is a co-founder.  

> (Sam notes that Vivek is also at Speechless, which may be another name for Qwill.)

> Kumail Nanjiani's co-host on a KDIC radio show.

> One of Sam's research students.

> SGA President.
