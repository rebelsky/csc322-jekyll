    * Part B #5
* Ask questions

Who are the actors?  (These are the people mentioned directly in the case.)

* Our company (regional ISP)

* Content provider
* You/your team

Who are the stakeholders?  (Some actors plus others affected by whatever
decision you make.)

* Oppressed people
* White supremacists
* Our other clients / content providers
* Politicians and others of that ilk
* General public
* Shareholders

What are the actions/choices that are available to you?

* Nothing.  Leave things as status quo.
    * Silently
    * Publicly, with news releases
* Pressure the content provider to remove the WS content / cancel their
  contract with the WS group
* Call together a discussion with all the stakeholders and all the media.
* Block access to the contrent provider
    * Silently
    * Publicly, with news releases
* Filter traffic based on content

What additional details would you like?

* Does the content provider have other ISP options?
    * What effect does this have on your decision?  (It depends a bit
      on your philosophical/ethical framework.)
* Are there other content providers available?
* What is the legal precedent?
* What are our Terms of Service.
* Do we expect retaliation?  If so, what kinds?

What aspects of the ACM code of ethics seem most relevant?

* 1.2 "Avoid Harm" (Push further than: "Don't build technology that causes
  harm." to "If you find that people use the technology you built causes
  harm ...")
    * Direct quote: "When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified and to minimize unintended harm."
* 1.4 "Take action not to discriminate".
    * What does it mean when our users discriminate?
    * Can we discriminate against our users when they discriminate?
* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
    * One form of public good: Freedom from violence.
    * Another form of public good: Freedom of expression.
