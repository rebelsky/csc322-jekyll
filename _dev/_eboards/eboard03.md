Quick introduction
------------------

Mayflower
---------

* Six folks in the project, but just one representative here today.
* Kent McClelland, Prof. Emeritus of Sociology
* A few blocks south of campus.
* Mayflower is a few hundred people.
* Formed as a retirement center for ministers.
* Has now broadened.  For example, lots of faculty live there.
  Lots of people who think it would be nice to live near the
  College.
* Mayflower community does lots of things.
* On paper.
* They should be doing some more things on computers.
* First goal: Directory
    * Like DB
    * It's been slow going
    * We have a working version, but ...
    * Not yet released
* Issues
    * Fixing blemishes
    * Better stylings
* Future projects (one of which might start this semester)
    * Calendar
    * Online minutes in easily accessible spot
    * Smart Phone application
* Needs some user experience stuff as well as UI stuff
* Needs testing and some new features
* Want it in a stage that students don't have to support it
* New people move in every month (and some depart)
* People also move around
* Privacy issues are important

Volunteer Board and Grant Application Management
------------------------------------------------

* Volunteer board provides a way for nonprofits to advertise
  volunteering opportunities and for volunteers to indicate
  their interest in doing so.
* Picked up and mostly finished last semester.  It should be
  done.  Fairly far along.  
* Unlikely to be picked up this semester; Sam hopes to have those
  students finish it, rather than pass it on to yet another group
* Grant application management: Applicants and reviewers (and
  administrators)
* Greyson and Matt attempted to comment the code to help you 
  understand what it does.
* Our partner Nicole is amazing and helpful.
    * But you also want to talk to the front-line people.
    * And to some of the clients (organizations)
* The Volunteer board will help your peers get connected to
  community partners.
* About GPCF
    * An organization that oversees a number of nonprofits.
    * A kind of a cooperative of nonprofits
    * Funds a lot of things, such as Tiger Packs
    * Back office support (financials, marketing, business
      management, etc.)
    * Unique/innovative model
* No CS background, but can talk well about what works and what
  doesn't work.

PALS Preview
------------

* Powesheik Animal League Shelter (cats and dogs)
* No public funding; entirely donations (and fundraisers)
* Established in 2007
* The current PALS project could be finished in one or two 
  semesters.
* Currently have an overall Web site and a community forum
  (discussion board) and the administrative structure (accounts,
  admin control) etc.
    * Looks like 1998.  Bring it into the 21st and a half century.
* Other planned features/issues:
    * Shift calendar - volunteer for shifts, keep track of shifts
    * Some "minor" bugs
    * Needs to be deployed
    * Mass texts to subgroups of people ("all catpeople at the
      college"_
    * Statistics about volunteers (helpful in grant writing)
* PALS just had a massive organization (administration, funding
  model, etc.)
    * Most excited about the volunteer management piece
* We may get the joy of shifting clients
* We support the organization, so there's less playing with
  the animals.
* PALS of PALS is our campus group.
* We have lots of service work study positions.

Notes about transportation
--------------------------

* Sam the Cabbie
* The CLS has an "apply for transportation" link on GrinCo.
  They need about a week's heads up.  They use campus vehicles.
  So there's a bunch of coordination.
    * Make sure that it's clear that it's a class project.
* If you are nineteen years old (or older) and have a clean US
  drivers record for two or more years, you can drive a campus
  vehicle.  Plus you can get paid to take people elsewhere.
* We know that many of you own your own vehicles; we would prefer
  that you not use those.

Continuing your work on projects
--------------------------------

* Opportunity to finish it
* Opportunity to do continued support if you think it's valuable
  to do.
* There's an application online under service-learning work-study
  on Grin-Co.
* Service-learning work-study is a chance to work with community
  partners, sometimes a continuation of projects from classes,
  sometimes Spark (no longer tank) projects, sometimes things
  coming from our community partners.
* "Not everyone has the privilege of time to volunteer"
* Also provides some education.
* (Your community partners may not distinguish the different
  ways in which the College partners with them.)
* There are also some students partnered with these organizations;
  you can draw upon their expertise.
* Email [WilsonKe].
