    over twenty years ago as a way to bring farm families, agribusiness,
    and community members together to recognize and celebrate all forms
    of agriculture and agribusiness as a major economic force in the
    greater Grinnell area.

Mayflower
---------

* We have a stand-in for the folks who have been leading the project.
  (They are on the east coast.)  Former faculty members help with the
  mentoring.
* Mayflower is a retirement community for people over 55.
* Just south of the Glove Factory.
* Mayflower wants to be involved in our community.
* Currently 150-200 residents.  Phone numbers aren't in the phone book,
  since they are cell phone numbers.  Email not known.
* People want to know how to contact each other.
* Paper is bad.  Things get out of date quickly.
* Dream is that the basic demographic information for all who opt in will
  be available - photo, address, phone number, email, etc.
* Longer-term dream: Short biography so that it's easier to find 
  commonalities.  Helpful for people who are not acquainted with
  the community.
* Password protected and available to anyone in Mayflower.
* Interest in privacy and other issues.

GPCF
----

* A bunch of projects that are near implementation phasse.
* Board bank: List expertise and skills and nonprofits can find people.
* Grant database: They do lots of grant maintenance.  Right now paper.
* Volunteer database: Like the board bank, but also provides calendar of
  volunteer opportunities in the community.  Helpful for people new to
  the community.

Local Foods Connection

PALS
----

* PALS is the anmial shelter for the town of Grinnell.
* Licensed for 20 dogs and 40 cats.  Their cats need homes.
* Only one paid staff member.  They stay open through volunteers.
* Need better ways to manage volunteers.  (PALS of PALS helps, too.)
* The animals need support 365 days per year.
* Better clarity of what is needed and what is available.

Peer Advocates
--------------

* Peer Advocates are a 24/7 support system for students who have
  experienced intimate partner violence and ....
* But people don't always seek support from Advocates.
* Sometimes they report to Title IX.  Sometimes they report to someone
  who has to report to Title IX.
* We have one way to report or file something anonymously.  It's more
  general.  It's not very friendly.  It's not used very much.
* Pathway of healing through expression.
* Project Callisto was designed to provide an interactive online entryway
  for people to record or as little or as much about something that has
  happened to them.  It can remain forever protected or they can choose
  at any time to file any report.  Can also set for triggering if the
  same person is reported multiple times.

Heartland Global Health Consortium
----------------------------------

* Group of colleges and universites in Iowa who are concerned about
  global health.
* There are various needs.  When people rotate in and out of positions
  things break.
* More shared governance of the Web site.
* Could include symposium sign-up (or related things).
* Data are disappearing from the Interweb.
* Opportunities to think broadly.
* Will mostly work with interesting information for the most part.
