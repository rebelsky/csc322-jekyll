Preliminaries

### Notes and news

* Welcome back!  I think I know most of you (at least from CSC 321), and I'm
  happy to be able to work with you again.
* I will take attendance.  (Who is in this class but not in 321?)
* For the first time in a few years, I think I've gotten the Web site for
  the course ready for prime time.  Please let me know if you notice problems.
    * A system misconfiguration made some pages unavailable.  I
      particularly appreciate hearing about those.
* Please fill out the Data Buddies survey that you received over break.
  <https://cerp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UH7q6TmdZ8YRPD>.
  Surveys are more meaningful if we get higher participation.
* Starting on Wednesday, I plan to have a cart of laptops in this
  room for you to work on.  (You'll probably prefer your own laptops,
  but ...)
    * Or would you prefer to be in 3818?

### Upcoming work

* Refresh your knowledge of Ruby by doing <https://github.com/saasbook/hw-ruby-intro>.  (Due ???.)
    * Those in CSC 321 will be doing those problems as part of the second
      homework in CSC 321.

### Good things to do: Academic
