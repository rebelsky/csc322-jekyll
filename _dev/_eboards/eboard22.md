### Questions

Demos
-----

Ethics case study, review
-------------------------

_Many of you have been using the ACM code of ethics in terms of how
your clients' client is using technology that we provide, but did not
invent.  I'd like to hear a bit more about why you think the code of
ethics applies in that case._

Ethics case study, part two
---------------------------

### Applying ethical theories

_You have been assigned an "ethical theory" group.  Get together with your 
group and decide how you would approach the problem through the lens of
that ethical theory.  (Yes, I realize that you may have to go back and
review that ethical theory.)_

Social contract: NA, FA, CB, MB

Deontology: EB, GC, WSC, MD

Consequentialism: HF, SG, MG, PT

Utilitarianism: JRL, PM, ArM, SM

Virtue ethics: JM, AdM, DN, LP

Justice as fairness: LP, JS, RS, JZ

### Primary options: Effects on stakeholders

_With your group, decide on the likely effects of each of the two major
decisions (do nothing / ban the client) on each of the major stakeholders._

### Grounding the case

_We will read and reflect on an actual case that underlies the theoretical
case._

Additional discussion of ethics in the CS curriculum (if time)
--------------------------------------------------------------

_I think that many of you never encountered a writing teacher who taught 
you not to write "I think"_

### For introducing ethics earlier / covering it more often

I think the coverage of ethics should be incorporated into the introductory class (CSC-151) itself, to give potential computer scientists a good grasp on the moral obligations of entering such a field. This way, ethics can be discussed over the course of their Grinnell education, as opposed to just in CSC-322 (which many students take in their last semester). In addition, ethics can be covered outside of class in events such as CS Tables and talks but keeping in mind that this is not inclusive for all students as many cannot make it to the talks. 

I think that integrating ethics into every course is ideal. This approach allows students to see the ethical implications of each technique taught from every class, which is more significant than teaching ethics in a separate class. On the other hand, another approach which could work is teaching the ethics of every technique which has been taught to us or will be taught to us. This will allow for teaching the ethics of techniques that has yet been taught to us. This could have a similar impact to the first approach, but it is not as consistent. I think consistency plays a big role in teaching any material, which the first lends itself to.

I think ethics should be integrated into every CS course, because that is how people internalize values: through day-to-day exposure in normal situations. Parents do not generally pick one day to sit their children down and give them an intensive lecture on ethics; they introduce ethical principles as they arise. The same tactic should be applied in academia.

There shouldn't be a dedicated course that aims to teach students about
ethics, rather it should be interspersed throughout all computing courses.
For example, during the final project of CSC-151, one group made a program
that approximated the chance of having breast cancer through its size.
It worked pretty well but it did have a sub 1% false negative rate which
the group brushed off as statistically insignificant. You re-iterated
that the 1% are still people whose lives might be hugely impacted which
resonated with me.  We could model few problems in classes that aim
to solve critical issues such as the example above and therefore raise
ethical questions about the results, implementation, or testing of it.
A course that aims to teach about ethics will often not be taken as
seriously by the students as one would want.

I think putting the discussion of ethics in this class does make a lot
of sense, since this could be the first time students are working with
actual clients, though it could be helpful to start the discussion
earlier. Introducing less in depth ethics questions in introductory
classes could help students awareness of ethical issues in computing,
and would allow students to have a basic understanding of computing
ethics before learning more in-depth about ethics in 321/2.

I think learning about ethics is important in all classes in one way or the other. The code of ethics do not only talk about the responsibilities of a software developer when working with a client, but also responsibilities of a software developer when they work with a team and how they must use their skills and knowledge to encourage the development of science and technology in a way that impacts the world for good. So, though CSC321/22 is the only class that deals with projects with clients, I believe that it is crucial to learn about ethics and how our work affects others in other classes. Like Narayan and Vallor point out in their article, "students should be in the habit of considering how the code they write serves the public good", it is important for us as college students to consider the impact of our work in each class even when we are writing code for ourselves. 

The article by Narayaan, et al. discusses two approaches to inserting coverage of ethics in software engineering/computer science curriculum. One is a adding a separate course taught through case studies, while the other is based upon integrating it within CS classes, with projects. There are merits to both types approaches—the first allows a look at the history of ethics in computation, while the second enables analysis of situations more like the workplace. Ideally, the integration of both approaches would be possible.
Drawing from my experience in the Evolution of Technology class at Grinnell, which talked about ethics of technology through a case study approach, I can attest to how the class changed my approach in considering a technological problem and its impacts. I think a separate class would emphasize the importance of ethics, which could perhaps be lost if it was integrated within our introductory courses. This would also be more of a liberal arts experience of a course specifically focused on the history of computation. However, the importance of forming good habits, as is emphasized for documentation in the introductory classes, is also essential to teaching students about ethics.

### For introducing ethics late

In my opinion I think coverage of ethics belongs in the portion of our curriculum right before we begin assigning projects to different groups within the class and begin meeting our respective clients. I think this should be the case because most ethics within software engineering pertain to some relation between a client and a group or the developers and the masses in general. I think this to be the case because as stated within the reading, Computing Ethics Why Software Engineering Courses Should Include Ethics Coverage, there is “potential for individual software engineers to produce great good, but with it naturally comes the ability to cause great harm, especially when combined with the ability to deploy code directly to end users.” As such, I believe that it is important for us to understand the potential of our own work to produce great good or more importantly, great harm in turn effectively making us that much more aware and careful with our actions.  

I think that the coverage of ethics fits perfectly in the courses that deal with the creation of software for consumption by the public (Like 321/322), but I also feel like some sort of ethics should be emphasized, like workplace ethics, earlier on in the curriculum. Before we ever get the chance to create software for a client, we are taught to write code and then to write it efficiently, but it is not meant for anything else but our learning. We do not worry about how our work will affect others until we begin creating programs for other people, and then that’s when we need to look at the ethics of creating software for others. Earlier on in the curriculum however, I think it’d be best to include ethics on creating more inclusive spaces, being respectful of different backgrounds, and a greater emphasis on how to work with a partner. This way people gain a larger understanding of what it means to be a good computer scientist outside of programming, and gain skills that can be used on an everyday basis.

To best understand the ethics of programming, one must have a good knowledge of programming itself and a beginner’s understanding of working on a programming team. I say this because there are ethics about how to treat your colleagues and client, which are skills that come with working on a team. Anyway, its best to learn ethics when you have a beginner’s understanding because if you wait to late, then it might be too late, and your experienced workflow might go directly against one or more ethic principles. Therefore, its best to learn about ethics about halfway through the semester. Due to students past in the CS courses, they will have a good understanding of programming, and being halfway through the semester, will have a starter’s knowledge of working on a team for one project.

I think it makes most sense to put the discussion of ethics in either 321 or, as it is now, 322, or alternatively in its own 1 or 2 credit course. Ethics is an important concept that should be considered by everyone creating a program used by anyone else, but that does not mean it should be covered in the first introductory Computer Science class. Practical classtime restrictions aside, people just starting with CS courses do not really have to think about whether the program they are making is good for society because they are purely completing school assignments and only submitting to the professor and/or graders. Furthermore, the ethics of computer science is a rather philosophical area that beginners are neither prepared for, in terms of programming experience, nor particularly interested in; they are more concerned with either getting a taste of CS or finishing requirements for later courses. 321 and 322 are the first times students get to create something used by the rest of the world in the standard curriculum, so it makes sense to teach it then. However, I think a way to separate it from 322 would be to allow students to take it on its own, possibly requiring the completion of all intro courses, since at that point they are actively signing up for it and should have a greater understanding of CS as a field.

I like the current placement of ethics in our curriculum, but I think
it could be expanded. Learning about ethics in the context of computing
while we are working on a project for a real client gives us a way of
seeing how these frameworks can be applied, and I think applying new
information is a great way of retaining it. 

I think it makes sense that we study ethics in 322 / the software development course, since it's the first time in the major we're creating software products for a client, rather than coding standalone assignments for our professors to grade. The other course I've taken which has a ethics section in the curriculum is AI, which also makes sense, considering the content of the course and the practical applications of what we learn and build. In the intro sequence, the programs we build don't have as much of an impact on society, and don't particularly serve a public good, so introducing ethics in this context seems premature. On the other hand, courses like 301 and 341 are far more theory focused, and again don't seem to serve as a course where discussions of ethics are applicable to the subject matter.

### CSC 207

I think covering ethics in 322 as is done currently is a good approach,
since, as we’ve discussed, it’s the first time many of us are making
software for clients in the real world.  However, I could also see it
being covered in 207, since that class involves some larger projects
and students, by that point, have enough experience with the mechanics
of programming that they can take a step back and think about good
practices to follow if they go into the field of software engineering
or other positions of technical expertise.

In the article it mentioned that habits are important to form. This made
me think about how it would look to include conversations about ethics
in some of the earlier courses.  Based on when many CS students look
for internships in industry, it would make sense to me if we had some
discussion of ethics in 207.

### A separate course

I agree with Narayaan and Vallor (March 2014), that habit is powerful,
and that integrating ethics into every class has the potential to be
very beneficial. However, in my opinion, a discussion of ethics in the
early CS courses at Grinnell would be fruitless. I do not think that
an early introduction or even fairly regular discussions throughout a
course of engineering ethics would make it so ethics are always in the
back of our minds when writing code for our assignments and labs. To
practice our coding skills as we learn new material, assignments and
labs propose problems that sometimes are not practical and will never be
released to the public. Instead, I propose covering ethics in a 2-credit
course that is mandatory for computer science majors and a prerequisite
or corequisite for 321/322.

I also would love to see
(and take) a separate course on ethics in computing. I think it would
work well to have conversations about ethics started more than once in
the curriculum, but explored in depth in one or two places (321/322,
a separate course).

### Other

In our curriculum, the coverage of ethics is mainly discussed in 321-322. We talked a lot about how to communicate with client, how to write better quality code and encouraged to write software that serves the community. In many lower level cs courses such as 151, 161 and 207, we also talked about decision in writing algorithm, what is the most efficient way to solve a problem, how much information or control do user have over the code and how to make the code modular and easy to understand. We also emphasized the idea of testing and always want to make sure to prove the correctness of the algorithm before pushing it to github or handing it to someone else.

The primary place it belongs is in a class on software just like how it is included in the syllabus for CSC322 at Grinnell. Professors cannot be expected to evaluate proposals and assignments for ethical risk as they already have such a heavy workload and that would be unfeasible. Similarly, I don't think it would be feasible for their to be a ethics department that reviews all assignments; the department of academic honesty does something similar but they do not review work for consistency with a computer science ethics code, rather a general ethics code. A professor could play the role of an ethics coach function as a confidential resource for students facing ethical dilemma.

We have talked about ethics couples times in class, and I believe it is well integrated into the curriculum. The article proposes a discussion of ethics with every significant technology they teach. Discussions of hypothetical cases are the examples of where ethics coverage come into our curriculum.
