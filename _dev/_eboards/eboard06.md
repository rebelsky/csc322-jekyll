### Questions

Background on strengths themes 
-------------------------------

* We are building teams.
* Sometimes we build teams based on knowledge of characteristics.
    * Myers-Briggs
* Strengths Quest was built from a study in which they surveyed
  Fortune 500 CEOs about important characteristics of successful
  people at their institutions.
* Replicable
* Based on sound psychological (or social theory)
* Sam thinks Strengths Quest is neither.  And he's willing to say
  that on a public Web site.
* But there's value in thinking about the skills on a team.
* We'll use them to think about how we work as teams.
