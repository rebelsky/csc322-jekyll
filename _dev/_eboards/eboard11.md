### Questions

Discussion question 1: Papers
-----------------------------

_What did you see as the core/important themes in these three papers?
Why?  How do/will they inform your own practice?_

* Computer scientists should gain the trust of the public.  That's hard,
  because we do so much crap as a discipline, but nonetheless.  The
  code o ethics would help us gain that trust of the public, as would
  following it.  Get good stuff publicized, too.
* What we write affects people: It can discriminate, it can shape how people
  think, it can shape how people act, it can use people's times.
* "Don't just live with intention; program with intention."
* We should think more carefully about whether or not some of these things
  are okay.
* Luis Van Ahn - Games with a purpose (idea: Write games that take advantage 
  of the fact that people do many things better than computers.)
    * ESP game: Two people see pictures.  They try to pick the same set of
      five adjectives to describe the picture.
        * Helps with image classification (reveals biases clearly)
        * Helps with machine vision algorithms
* Value of standards: Law, Medicine, Engineering
    * It could be useful to look into the histories of these.
    * In the US, each of these professions gets certified.  Ours
      does not.

Discussion question 2: Curriculum
---------------------------------

_Where would you put ethics in the Grinnell CS curriculum?_

* Context: Right now, we have ethics
    * Two-Three days in CSC 322
    * A paper in CSC 322
    * CS Table (not required)
    * Some CS Extras (not required)
    * In unplanned places in courses (optional)
* Is there value for doing it (more formally) earlier?
* Are there particular cases that are useful as we introduce it?
* Add another P: Principles?  (Find a greek word that means ethics and
  starts with P)
* It needs to be regular practice.
