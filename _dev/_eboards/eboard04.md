Quick introduction
------------------

Local foods
-----------

* A nonprofit that is relatively new to Grinnell, but around since
  1999.
* Find local growers who farm in an environmentally just way.
* Find community members who don't have easy access to that food.
* Make connections.
* It's more than just providing the food, it's also providing
  information on how to use the food.  Last year they did a demo
  at MICA.  There's a lot of work to do.
* Another goal is to identify barriers to using the food.
* Last semester's group built page to allow all of the community
  to find local resources.
    * Farmers can enter their own information.
    * Plus some sensible administrative support.
    * Cool visuals.  (Still in progress.)
    * Also recipes.
* What kind of information do we get from farmers?
    * Location
    * Name of farm
    * Typical things they grow/raise
    * CSA
    * Other features
    * Events
* New feature: Calendar

Callisto
--------

* On-campus project.
* Begun last semester.
* Recording and reporting by victim/survivors of sexual assault.
* Currently multiple approaches for reporting
    * Title IX office
    * Confidential resources (CRSSJ, SHACS, Advocates)
    * HR-based reporting system
* One issue: Anonymous reporting and sense of identifying threats
  to campus with the same person getting multiple reports.
* Another: These issues are underreported.
* There are benefits to being able to create a report (mostly
  for their own purposes).
* Callisto was created for these purposes.
* It does some of what we want, but not everything we want.
* It is also costly.
* Our primary interest is as a compassionate resource.
* Last semester we validated that this can be done and some of
  the related issues.
    * IP issues
    * Secure third-party storage
    * Python and Django
* Needs significant modification.  We need to extend it for things
  like intimate partner violence.
* Advocates and others are thinking through the issues of the
  front end.
* We're working on supporting that, including through a more 
  complex back-end.
* Variety of tasks, such as more resource information.
* Multiple clients: Advocates, Title IX, SHACS
* Status?
    * Back-end works well, except for conditional questions.
    * But conditional questions are a huge undertaking.
    * Front-end should mostly be getting the questions in and
      better styling.

Debrief/review
--------------

Survivor support

* Different platform: Python/Django
    * Overall logic is the same
    * Python isn't that hard to pick up
    * Learning custom is slower
* Building on an open-source code base
* Opportunity to make a difference.
* Documented many important issues
* Lots of legal issues that cause tension

Local Foods

* Very active partner
* Planting season comes soon!
* Different architecture Javascript + Rails backend

PALS

* Partner transition (potential shift in focus)
* Likely to be a long-term, multi-faceted project

GPCF - Grants

* Finish a project
* Worry about issues like document storage on a separate system

Mayflower

* Likely to be a long-term, multi-faceted project
* Able to finish one project and move on to the next.
* UI design opportunities

Heartland - Global Health Cooperative

* Likely to be more open ended.
* Very local client
* Interesting combination of local and global.
