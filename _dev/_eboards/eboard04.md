===========================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries
    * Notes and news
    * Upcoming work
    * Extra credit
    * Questions
* GPCF
* Mayflower
* Local Foods Connection
* PALS
* Callisto
* Heartland Global Health Consortium
* A bit of time to rank

### Admin

* Our goal for today is to go over the projects and help you think about
  which ones might be appropriate for you.
* It appears that there was some confusion on the assignment for today.

### Upcoming work

* Continue to work on your résumé; you'll be bringing it to class Thursday.
* Three interesting challenges for each of the six projects.
* Three interesting opportunities for each of the six projects.

### Good things to do

#### Academic

* CS Table today: Doxxing.
* Rosenfield symposium, this week.  (Lots of different events)

#### Misc

* Community Hour (Dialogues Across Difference), Today at 11 a.m. in JRC 101.
* CLS Kick-Off Event, Tuesday at 11 a.m. in North Campus Grove.
* Les Duke

### Questions

GPCF
----

* Goal: Finish three projects that are mostly done and get them in the
  clients' hand.
    * Volunteer coordination (different than PALS)
    * Board bank
    * Grant management
* Involves some coding (and re-coding), a lot of working with the client
  to make sure that their needs are really met, a bit of support, some
  interesting sysadmin stuff (how do we really deploy), etc.

### Opportunities

* Learning how to handle a codebase that is (almost) finished
* I find the GPCF project interesting because hopefully we would be able to fully implement our work and see it in its final state. 
* Creating a website that directs people to different databases according to their needs 
* Include database people looking for volunteers 
* Automatically suggests match between volunteers and people looking for volunteers according to listed expertise and skills, and needs
* To finish projects that are near completion
* Gives experience with database building
* To build on the tail-end of others’ work

### Challenges

* The GPCF project presents some difficulties because there are quite a few projects that are close to implementation, which means navigating and learning other peoples code. 
* Working with the legacy codes on the projects near implementation phase 
* Introducing and advertising the databases to the community
* For Grant Database: Migrating grant information online would be a very long, manual process
* Same issue of privacy as in Mayflower
* Issue of maintenance
* As Sam said, the last little bit can be the hardest part
* Multiple projects to work on
* Because almost finished, lots of old code to parse through

### Other notes

Mayflower
---------

* Goal: Finish the directory
* Goal: Start whatever comes next in the Web of Mayflower (WoM)

### Opportunities

* I find the Mayflower project interesting because the software would be used by people who most likely have had minimal experience with computers in the past, so a focus of the project would be accessibility. 
* Implement a keyword search so that the website automatically finds people with commonalities through keywords 
* Creating a simple edit page so that residents can edit the contact information easily 
* Creating an event section to share and communicate posts on any events around the community 
* Hopefully be able to work with the volunteers of the Mayflower community
* Experience with mid-project design
* Experience with privacy-related topics
* Directly helping people

### Challenges

* Initial registering of the contact information (photo, address, phone number, email, etc) on the server, if it is not already gathered, would be a long process
* Teaching 150-200 residents about the features and how to use it.
  Kathryn says "Not our job"
* Communicating with the stand-in folks in the east coast about the project 
* Digitizing the already already available phone numbers
* Concern of whether the directory can somehow be accessed by telemarketers
* Accessibility for people who may be unfamiliar with technology
* Specialized topics (privacy, etc.)
* Coming in midway
* Needs to be designed for non-tech-savvy individuals

### Other notes

Local Foods Connection
----------------------

* Goal: Build web site to support "local foods to local needs", focus
  on geo-based visualizations of where the food is coming from.
    * Education value
    * Fundraising value
    * Grantwriting value

### Opportunities

* Creating a communicating space on the website so that consumers can contact local farmers 
* Posting updates about local farming community 
* Creating events between local community and farmers to raise awareness 
* More directly helping people in need
* Experience to work closely with web design
* Specified skills (maps, etc.) to learn

### Challenges

* Building the geo-searhcable database
* How (and if) to allow others to contribute to this database
* Since the focus is lower-income people, they may not have the same level of access to the website
* Connecting the complex search engine with map would be interesting but also challenging
* It may take more than a semester to finish the website, and thus documenting the code and keeping a log of things to be updated would be important
* The website will be useful only when people in the community use it. Thus, it would be essential to inform and advertise the people about the features the website provides
* Specified skills (maps, etc.) must be learned
* Also start from scratch
       Many goals wrapped in one, less specific focus

### Other notes

* A chance to think about how best to visualize the data and other
  stuff.
* Will it be accessible / how big an audience?  Sam thinks valuable.

PALS
----

* Goal: Make it easier to manage volunteers

### Opportunities

* Add work description section so that volunteers can sign up for work they wish to do 
* Include various pictures and information about the animals to raise awareness 
* Post car pool services if there are any people going on same direction 
* Learning how to start from scratch
* Experience with preliminary design meetings
* Relatively simple software (not saying easy to make, but simple to comprehend)

### Challenges

* Collecting the volunteer information without discouraging them with complex procedure is important
* It would be nice to have a reminder system that checks with the signed up volunteers so that if they cannot make it, volunteers in the waitlist can be contacted beforehand
* Implementing a smart scheduler system so that volunteers in the waitlist can be contacted for any other empty spots to make sure animals are supported 365 days per year. 
* Starting from scratch
* No prior work or ideas to rely on
* Not going to see the project completed, probably not even recognizable as a product

### Other notes

* Do we have to interact with the animals/volunteer?
    * Probably not/no.
* The GPCF Volunteer Thingy will provide you with a starting resource
  for you to think about.

Peer Advocates / Callisto
-------------------------

* System for confidentially recording sexual assault (or similar issues)
* Kind of scary that we're doing this
* Python/Django
* Some indirect contact with the developers
* Will it be installed if we build it?  Almost certainly.

### Opportunities

* The deep encryption system it will be interacting with 
* Real impact that I can see it having on the Grinnell college community. 
* Implementing different ways to report or file an incident 
* Creating an anonymous community post place where people can talk or express their feelings 
* Allowing individual password protected page so that they can file or withdraw their reporting at anytime without privacy concerns 
* Supporting OSS (If I heard correctly).  (Sam says: "Yes")
* Working with the people of the CRSSJ.
* Again, more directly helping people
* Experience starting a project
* Needs to be user-friendly in design, emphasized

### Challenges

* I think the peer advocates project would be challenging because of the back end system that it would be interacting with, it would mean learning a new system with an unknown level of usability/documentation. 
* Issue of privacy: will we have to deal with information that may identify students who file reports?
* Finding required documentation on Callisto
* If it is hosted with a third party, whether that third party can be trusted that information.
* Privacy and permission issue on who has access to the database for reported incidents.  (Sam says **No one!**   All data should be transmitted and stored in encrypted form.)
* Deciding on how much information is required for reporting an incident through the system  (Sam says: This may already be in place.)
* Working with part of the interactive online platform that already exists 
* Very specific work, needs to be fairly precise
* Just starting fresh
* Very somber topic, not going to be so enjoyable to work with
* Python on Django rather than Ruby on Rails.

### Other notes

Heartland Global Health Consortium
---------------------------------

### Opportunities

* Allow read only permission and provide website information to other college students to raise awareness about global health 
* Link various global health related website so that visitors and members can access more resources if they wish to 
* Create a back-up system so that all changes are documented and no data are lost in the process 
* Experience in website design
* More national/global perspective
* Thinking about robustness through changing of users/administrators

### Challenges

* I think the heartland global health consortium would a challenging project overall because it would be working with large amounts of data
* It seems like the partner does not have a super clear idea of what she is looking for, all in all it seems super open-ended.
* Maintaining permissions on changing the website among the administration
* Overcoming the institutional barriers and allowing all members to post on the website
* Working with the existing website (code base)
* Finding a hosting provider
* Multiple aspects
* First Grinnellians to work on it, but outsiders did, so possible difficulties entering in
* Very broad terms

### Other notes

* Open-ended means that you can probably take it where you want it.
  That's a good opportunity.
* A chance for you to transform thinking.
* Good for people okay with big risk/big gain.
* Opportunity to think about how to migrate data (from their old site,
  from the rapidly disappearing governement Web sites)
* May be having to satisfy a variety of people, but only have contact
  with one.
* Do we have access to the other stuff?
