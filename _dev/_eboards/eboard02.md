### Questions

Context
-------

* Susan does a lot of work with faculty who do community projects.
* That means working with what Sam calls "real people".
* You are not creating software for an annoying faculty member; you are
  now creating it for a meaningful situation.

Introductions
-------------

What are you excited by or challenged about?

* See what we can do with real
* Different models of communication / how do we translate world views
* See at least one project come to completion
* Coming to consensus about what the product should be.  
    * Susan notes that there are transitions in clients
* Odd to take a leadership role rather than just do what I'm told
* Make a difference to this community, something that may have a legacy
* Different sets of standards and detail (exciting and challenging)
* Different concerns and risks
* Working in a different group setting (challenges and complexities)
    * Group dynamics can be hard
    * Channel your inner New Yorker and be blunt when someone is frustrating you
* Build (or make progress on) a product; a crazy amount of work (positive)
* Build relationships
    * Susan reminds Sam that he should ask for feedback from the 
      community partners
* It's intimidating to have to satisfy clients' needs.  
    * Our community partners are *incredibly* understanding.
    * They realize that it is primarily a learning experience.
* Transition to a new team; New leaders, etc.
* Building things that will be used by people
* Not just code.
* Getting feedback on people who are using things.
* Deadlines and expectations.
    * You have a lot of control.
    * You need to set realistic expectations for yourself and your team
      with your partners.
    * Don't overcommit.
* Taking over a project from other people.
* Group: Dividing up the work, identifying different strengths, etc.
    * It's okay to draw on your strengths
    * But you should push yourself out of your group
* Maybe finishing something
* Using this as a way to figure out what I want to do with my life
* Excited about improving communication skills
* Worried about miscommunication
    * Nice to do follow-up email
    * Regular meetings are good
    * Sketches
* Something that continues throughout the semester, rather than a new
  project each week.
* Excited about developing skills, scared about that too.
    * That's one of the reasons that Susan is here.
* Worried about inherited codebase.
    * You should be, even when it's great.
    * It's hard to pick up someone else's project.
* Something helpful for others
* Driving vs. Navigating

An overview of our community (Grinnell)
---------------------------------------

* How many people live in the town?  About 9,000, not including the school.
    * Get chocolate from Susan's as a reward for guessing (right or not)
* That includes our rural community.
* How do you know what's happening in town?
    * Newspaper: _Grinnell-Herald Register_, twice per week, 75 cents.
      Requires disposable income.
* What percentage of our community live at or below the poverty line?
    * Guesses: 24, 30, 36
    * Depends on the statistics you use, it's 30%
    * But more qualify for food stamps, 40-50%
* How else do you get information?
    * Networks of friends
    * Radio (1410 KGRN).  Gives you a great sense of our community.
      Listen at 7am or so.
    * Internet.
* Our schools now have a one laptop per child program.  
    * What happens when a kid goes home with an assignment like "watch this
      video"?
    * Not everyone has Internet access
    * Some folks who live 5 miles from town have no access to DSL.  One 
      option is Cell Phone as a modem.  How much for 30gb per month?
      About $400.
    * Most people rely on their cell phones.
    * Smart phones are common, but not with a whole lot of data.
* What's the unemployment rate in Grinnell?
    * Guesses: 40%, 18%, 10%, 7%, 4%, 
    * Answer: 3.8%
    * Our community is made up primarily of working poor, people working
      two or three jobs to make ends meet.
* If the organization needs volunteers
    * Mobile friendly
    * Commute distances
    * Having time to be active in the community (and time of day)
* If you want to learn more, do one of the community social justice tours
  with Susan.

What are your biases about our community (the "townies")

* "Uneducated"
* "Racist"
* "Older"
* "Guns"
* "Only drive American cars"
* "White"
* "Trump supporters"

What forms these impressions?

* Some encounters, such as the truck
* Global perceptions of Iowa
* Social media

What are our community's biases about Grinnell students?

* Arrogant
* Smart
* Rich
* Spoiled
* International
* Hard-working (???)
* Druggies
* Communists
* PC
* Colonialists

Why are we discussing these biases?

* We should be aware of them and maneuver around them
* Please try to represent the College well
* If you experience some of these biases, please come to Sam or Susan
* Are there concerns about the College failing to use its money to 
  help the town?  Yes.
* But our community partners understand what it means to work with us.

Working with real human beings
------------------------------

* Please talk loudly
* When can you text your community partner?  Can you text your partner?
    * **Ask Them!**
* Set up communications agreements.
    * Some prefer text
    * Some prefer email
    * Some prefer phone calls
* More agreements
    * If I don't hear from you, when should I follow up?
    * "One to two business days" is reasonable.  But asking is good, too.
* And more
    * How often should we meet?  Sam suggests every two weeks.
    * Think about bullet points and explicit questions with numbers.
    * Work on translating technical to normal
* Email should be formal, at least at first, even if they don't respond
  that way.  Start on the conversative side.
    * Dear Mr./Ms./Mx./Prof. etc ...
* Professional dress
    * Depends on the situation
    * Start more formal than normal and then take queues
* Concepts of time differ.  In town, time is pretty exact.  Be there on
  time or a few minutes early.
* Set up appointments as far in advance as possible.  A week or more may
  be necessary.
* A good response when you're too busy
    * I'm really busy right now and can't get that done promptly.
    * I will get back to you on X.
* Confidentiality.  Honor it.
* Make eye contact!
