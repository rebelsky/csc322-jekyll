### Questions

Context
-------

* You will be working with folks in the community.
* Susan is an expert in these things, so will be talking to you.
* Question for you - Exciting / Scary?
    * Lots of things are exciting, particularly working on a real project
      and having a chance to make a difference.
    * Lots of things are also scary, including time commitment

Community questions

* How many people live in Grinnell?
* What does Susan pay for Internet (leaving five miles outside of
  town)?  About $400/month for 30 gigabytes of data.  This is common
  in rural settings.  In town, you can get DSL for a more affordable
  rate.  But once you are out of the town, there's less interest in
  providing service.
* Poverty rate is somewhere between 30% and 50%, depending on how
  you define poverty.
* 40% of students in our district are on free and reduced lunches
  (that probably under-counts).
* Drops in high-school because there is a stigma (and for other
  reasons).
* What is the unemployment rate in our community?  About 2.8%
  percent?
* What does that mean about our demographics?  People are underemployed
  and/or making very low wages.  Most people work multiple jobs.
    * Sam won't put particular examples in the eboard.
* Grinnell is a "food desert" - food may not be easily available outside
  of town.  Access can be hard.
* No public transportation in Grinnell.  No taxi.  One Uber.
* What is a childcare desert look like?  Also difficult to get people
  to take care of your children.  How many child care centers are open
  a full workday?
    * Workdays vary significantly: E.g., night shift.
    * Only one is open for 9-5.  And that has a waiting list.
* What infrastructure supports all of this?  In a large, metro, area,
  there are options for support (e.g., for building software) when you
  are a nonprofit.  You can ask a neighboring company or ask them for
  money or even rely on organizations designed to do this.  While you
  are only working for only one organization, you are making a difference.
* If you want to know more about these issues and how to be involved 
  beyond this class, talk to Susan and/or her colleague Keira.
    * We know that not everyone has the privilege to have time to
      volunteer without pay.  Hence, we have workstudy service
      positions.
    * [sannings] and [wilsonke]
* What are your preconceptions of the community?
    * [Sam does not record these.]
* What does our community think about us?
    * "Rich, pretentious, jerks" - Many of them think that all of you
      can pay the sticker price.  They do not know the demographics or
      need-blind admissions or financial aid.
    * What accompanies misperception of wealth: Arrogance, "You aren't
      even looking at me.", 
    * People will project onto them
    * "Savior complex"
    * "They don't understand us."
    * The conversation is completely different when you are speaking
      as an Iowan rather than as a College student.
    * Students often suggest that they don't like our town.
    * Do we understand community standards?

Why are we discussing this?

* To help us be more conscious of who we are and how we are percieved.
* Be intentional in how you behave and communicate.
* Try to overcome some of your own preconceptions.

Dress

* Do you need to wear a coat and tie?  No.
* If you are meeting someone on a farm: Wear jeans, closed-toed shoes,
  etc.  "I respect you enough to know what I should be wearing."
* What would you wear to an animal shelter?  (Maybe our current
  partner wouldn't care about what you wear, but if it were somene
  else ...?)
* How do you decide?  Look at what they are wearing.  What else?
  Google it!  Check their Web site.

Communication

* What is the most professional mode of communication?
    * Face to face?
    * Phone?
    * Email?
    * Slack?
    * Facebook messenger?
    * Textbook?
    * See what their Web site says.
    * Whatever they prefer.  Ask them.
* When can you text?
    * Business hours, unless you've heard otherwise.
    * Keep good boundaries.
    * Ask them.  Some won't want to be texted during business hours.
* How often should you communicate?
    * As often as they want.
    * As often as you are makng decisions.
    * Probably once per sprint.
    * More fun things for the inititial meeting: How often should I
      communicate with you to make sure that you are in the loop?
* Acronyms and coded language?
    * LOL, JRC, CLS, CS, DRY, "User Story", NAA (Not At All), GitHub
      "Push", "Pull", "Deploy", "Heroku", ...
