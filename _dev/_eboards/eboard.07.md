### News / Etc.

* In CSC 322, it's generally good to plan to sit with your group.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help!  (From me, from your classmates, from
  Adam, from the Interweb.)
* Office supplies in the commons.  Free will donations.
* Please let me know ASAP if you notice things missing from the Web site.
  I'm still getting up to speed on Jekyll; this course suffers the most.
* Yes, you can schedule meetings with clients (and, soon, with mentors) 
  during class time (other than Mondays).  Just give me advance notice
  so that I can schedule other issues appropriately.
* Class time Wednesday will be spent on meeting with clients or just
  working as teams on user stories.
* Friday will be more ethics.

### Questions

Please put the readings in the schedule.

* Okay.

Background
----------

* Most of you, at some time or other, will be developing software.
* We do a lot of implicit consideration of your responsibilities as
  a software developer.
* We need some formal considerations, too.
* Our "software design" sequence is a natural home for such considerations.
    * We should do more early.
* These issues used to be in CSC 321.
* But you're building the software in CSC 322, so that's a good time to
  talk about it.
* Assumption: Most professions have codes of ethics.  E.g., "Do know harm."
    * Expresses standard expectations of behavior.
    * Guide professionals when they make difficult decisions
    * Allow prof organizations to censor professionals
    * Reminder to behave well
* Ideally, you have a deeper set of guiding moral and ethical principles
  that guide your behavior and that cohere with the stated codes of ethics.
* The guidelines have more force, because they have two professional 
  organizations behind them.

Key responsibilities
--------------------

*Yay!  We did a group reading.  Sam asked random questions along the way
and forgot to include them in the eboard.*

Reflection: What responsibilities are particularly pertinent for your project?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Read through the responsibilities again as a group, and identify the
three that seem most relevant to your project.*

CS Course Planning

* 1.8. Honor confidentiality.  Need to worry about student data.
  (As well as what the department chair tells you that may not be
  for public dissemination.)
* 2.3. Know laws, like FERPA.
* 2.6. Honor contracts.  To Grinnell College and to SamR.
* But all of them are important.

SpamR

* 1.8. Honor confidentiality.  What information in csstudents should not
  be public?
* 1.5. Observe copyright (and patent).  We will likely steal a lot of
  code, so we should do so ethically.
