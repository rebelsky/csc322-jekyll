    * Questions
* Introduction/context
* A case study

Preliminaries
-------------

### News / Etc.

* I am, as always, behind on grading.
* Your mentor will be distributing a survey on good times to help with
  your projects.
* Rails can be difficult to debug.  Your "code thinking" skills will get
  a lot of workout this semester.  (Mine, too.)

### Upcoming work

* [More readings on professional ethics](../readings/ethics02) due next
  Thursday at 9:00 pm.
* Reports Friday at 5:00 p.m.
* In-class reports Monday.

### Good things to do (Academic/Artistic)

### Good things to do (Peer)

### Good things to do (Misc)

* President White dive competition.
* GHS Basketball

### Friday PSA

* You are awesome wonderful people, please take care of yourselves.
* Moderation.

### Questions

Introduction/context
--------------------

* We will be talking about professional ethics in computing
* We try to talk about these issues throughout the curriculum.
    * "This is a way that computing impacts the world; think about the implications
      of what you do."
    * CS Table provides one opportunity to think about the role of computers
      in society
* We need some more formal coverage as well as the informal coverage.
    * Early in the curriculum may not provide enough context
    * In software design, because that's when ethics really comes into play
    * In 322, because that's when you're working with a client
* At least two ways you think about ethics
    * "What are my general responsibilities as a member of society who computes
      and understands computing?"
    * Computing is a profession; Professions (sometimes) have codes of ethics.
      We use the ACM Code of Ethics.
* At least two ways to understand ethics
    * "Practical" - A general framework that you practice applying
    * "Theoretical" - Grounded in a deeper framework of ethics
* We will focus more on practical than theoretical approaches
* Process:
    * Read some papers
    * Try to work through some thorny problems
    * Try to ground our work in the code and in simplistic views of ethical
      frameworks
    * Write something

Quick review: Ethical frameworks
--------------------------------

Social contract: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract>

* You consent to give up rights in exchange for social order.
* Prioritization of social order as highest value.
* Social order is (potentially subjective, based on the society).

Deontology: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics>

* You act in according to your duty to "the highest good".
* E.g., "Be honest".  "Follow orders".

Consequentialism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism>

* "Ends justify the means"; focus on the consequences, rather than the
  action itself.  Focuses less on rules than on what you accomplish.

Utilitarianism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism>

* Choose the thing that maximizes utility.  Sum the pleasures of everyone
  and subtract the misery.  Maximize well-being.

Virtue ethics: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics>

* There are traits that make you a good person.  Follow those traits.
  (Honesty, courage, temperance, modesty, friendliness, ...)

Justice as fairness: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice>

* Provide the greatest amount of liberty without infringing upon the liberty
  of others.
* Equality of opportunity.
* Focus on the least fortunate.

A case study: Bypassing security mechanisms
-------------------------------------------

A1. Who are the relevant *actors* in the case?  (Someone who plays a role
in the case.)

* The company
* The criminal
* The judge
* Law enforcement agencies (the Feds)
* You

A2. Who are the relevant *stakeholders* in the case?  (Some who may be affected
by your decision.)

* Users of the software/hardware
* Citizens of the country
* The criminal (and their cohort)
* Other companies (who may be told "Banana made this choice.  You should, too."
* Future judges of cases, who may take this as a precedent. (?)
* Shareholders of our company

A3. What are possible *actions* or *choices* to be made?

* Say "No"
* Make the software and give it to the government
* Make the software and give it to no one (proof of concept)
* Make the software and release it to the public (since the government will
  probalby allow it to be leaked to hackers in any case)
* Choose a very different technical approach; leave the password delay but add
  some other feature that gives access to the data.
* Distribute the software and an update that magically blocks the update.
  (Everyone else can update except for the one phone.)
* "I'm sorry, but that is not technically feasible."
    * Truth
    * Lie

B5. What are the relevant sections of the ACM code of ethics?

B2. What *rights* of actors and stakeholders might be impacted?
