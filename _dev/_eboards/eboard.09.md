### Questions

Discussion of readings
----------------------

You read three papers

* "Arvind Narayaan and Shannon Vallor (March 2014). Why software engineering courses should include ethics coverage. _Communications of the ACM_ 57(3): 23-25.  <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2566966>"
* "Neil McBride (August 2012). The ethics of software engineering should be an ethics for the client. _Communications of the ACM_. 55(8): 39-41.  <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2240250>"
* "Deborah G. Johnson (October 2008). Computer experts: Guns-for-hire or professionals? _Communications of the ACM_ 51(10): 24-26.  <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1400190>"

We will spend about 2/3 the class in groups of about four students,
talking about the following questions.  I will then ask each group to
give a short report about their conclusions on each issue.

### What do you see as the central issues raised by these papers?

### What particular issues regarding ethical and professional responsibility are raised by SaaS?

* How do you deal with the "client" vs the "user" issue?  To whom is
  your responsibility?
* Transparency: Make it clear what you are changing.  
    * Transparency and the client: Make sure they understand what you are doing (as best they/you can)
    * Transparency about the data you are collecting.
* Consider broader implications.  (Do we have a responsibility as developers
  to think about that?  How will our software be used?)
* Given that you can roll out updates whatever you want, what responsiblity
  do you have for informing people about those updates and thinking about
  their effects?
* Ability to gather large amounts of data.  What responsibilities does that
  give?
* Think about the power dynamic.
* How do you balance the different needs and perspectives of different users?
* Is SaaS itself ethical?  It changes notion of ownership vs. service?

### Suppose you had one day of CSC 151 to get students thinking about these issues.  How would you structure that class (50 or 80 min)?

### Suppose you thought we should increase the coverage of these issues in our curriculum.  How would you do so?

### Unforeseen consequences: The Twitter example

* Then: Look, it empowers people by allowing them to communicate and 
  organize without government interference!  (E.g., arab spring).
* Now: Look, it allow large numbers of people to attack a single person
  or group as well as to transmit news-like substances.
