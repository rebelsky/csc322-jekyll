### News / Etc.

* Remember the project reports are due EVERY FRIDAY at 5 p.m.
    * Make sure to include me, KY, GB, and MG in the recipient list
* About extension requests.
    * Reasonable: I got really sick and haven't been able to work the
      past two days.  Can I have an extension?
    * Reasonable: I need to help a friend with an emergency and haven't
      been on top of my game.  Can I have an extension?
    * Reasonable: In looking ahead to next week, I see that I have more
      things do than I can do a good job on.  Can I have an extension?
    * Unreasonable: I had more things than I could do, all of which I knew
      about a few weeks ago.  I know the assignment is due today.  Can
      I have an extension?
    * And yes, I realize that my own delays sometimes match the "unreasonable"
      model, at least from the outside.  (More often, I'm dealing with 
      something like the second one.)

### Upcoming Work

_Please put your assignments in your planners or equivalent._

* Read chapter 4 of POODR for Tuesday.  (And please do it this time.)
* Paper: Comparatively reflect on the [the new draft ACM code of
  ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/2018-code-draft-2/).  
    * E.g., What changes do you see as particularly important?
      What other changes do you think should still be made?  What else
      belongs?  What doesn't belong?  Etc.
    * Comparison to prior code of ethics.
    * Reflection on what needed to change given the change in
      computer technology.
    * Approximately 1000 words.  Correct grammar and spelling.  I may
      invoke the MC/JS rule if there are multiple problems with grammar
      or spelling.
