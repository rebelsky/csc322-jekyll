Prep time

_You have four hours outside of class each week to work on your project.
You've had about one and a half weeks.  Groups of 6 therefore have 36 hours 
of person work done and groups of 5 have 30.  What have you accomplished in that time?  Please present
with appropriate context.  You will have five minutes._

Some things to consider.

* What is your project (for your classmates who don't remember)?
* What have you accomplished so far?
* What are your goals for the next week or two?
* What are some useful user stories for us to hear?
