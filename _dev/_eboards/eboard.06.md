* Please let me know ASAP if you notice things missing from the Web site.
  I'm still getting up to speed on Jekyll; this course suffers the most.

### PSA

Debriefs
--------

The questions I will ask.

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
* What are your next steps?
* What challenges do you anticipate?
* How much do you think you can accomplish this semester?
* Questions from the other groups

### Mayflower

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
    * We thought is was going to be a social network.
    * They want more of a directory / information page.  
    * They want "DB" but for Mayflower residents
    * With other features: 
        * Calendar for events
        * FAQ
        * Floorplans of houses
    * Memorial page for members of the community (with sign-in
      access for community members).  Is this accomplishable?
* What are your next steps?
    * Review ideas
    * Meet with clients next Wednesday to understand priorities
    * Talk to Sam about what is possible.
    * Interview some potential users about what they can do
      with technology.
* What challenges do you anticipate?
    * How much can old people do with technology?  (Answer: Lots,
      if they are motivated.)
    * Working in a big team; need ways to segment work.
    * Security; we're not that skilled.  (And they are not that
      skilled, either.)
    * They want a lot more than can be done in a semester.
* How much do you think you can accomplish this semester?
    * We're working on keeping it reasonable.
    * Focus on the DB/Profile.
* Questions from the other groups
    * Ask them: Didn't they want a way to identify people with common
      interests?
    * Consider talking to Jake Madren in ITS, who runs DB

### Volunteer Board

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
    * A way for the organization to create events and keep track
      of how comes to them.
    * Rate volunteers.
    * Keep track of events: Where they are, who is coming, who
      actually shows up.
    * A way for volunteers to see events and express interest, but
      requires approval.
    * They pay for software to do this already.
    * They want organizations to reach out to them to create an account.
* What are your next steps?
    * Meet with community partner to look at what they already have.
      Need to set date!  Need to assign a liaison.
    * Set up basic framework (but probably need more knowledge)
    * Talk to Board Bank group ; you may find synergies
* What challenges do you anticipate?
    * The "check in" issue.
    * Making everything come together.
    * Start thinking about the different roles.
* How much do you think you can accomplish this semester?
    * Create accounts.
    * Set up events.
* Questions from the other groups

### CS Academic Job Board - "Tall Order"

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
    * Bringing opportunities to students to a centralized site would
      be good.  (Hmmm ... are we replicating GrinnelLINK + SpamR?)
    * Portal for students, alumni, etc.
    * Need ways to authenticate
* What are your next steps?
    * Set goals.
    * Overall structure.
* What challenges do you anticipate?
    * Unclear expectations of what we are doing.
    * Authentication! / Limited access?
    * Coordinating with GrinnellLINK?
* How much do you think you can accomplish this semester?
    * Everything other then authentication, limited access, and
      coordination with GrinnellLINK.
* Questions from the other groups
    * If it's really for students, will it include academic research
      opportunities, such as REUs or on-campus MAPs?

### SpamR

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
    * Students don't read email, even when it has important information
      like announcements of job boards.
    * People would like to read postings that were made in the past.
    * So our goal is to archive all of the emails.  Yay!
    * Could serve as a filtering system; rather than subscribing to
      the mailing list, you could subscribe to this thingy and indicate
      subsets you want to receive and don't want to receive. 
* What are your next steps?
    * Bad jokes.
    * Think about the data model.
    * Start writing use cases.
    * Make a bare bones site using Rails generate.
    * Learn how to make email redirect to a Web site.
* What challenges do you anticipate?
    * Everything.
    * MIME-encoded email with attachments (blame Nathaniel)
    * Insufficient vision
    * Security (?)
    * Unavailable client
    * Telling a coherent story
* How much do you think you can accomplish this semester?
    * An archive with a front end.
    * That will take input from mail.
* Questions from the other groups

### CS Curricular Planning

* What did you learn from your client (summary)?
