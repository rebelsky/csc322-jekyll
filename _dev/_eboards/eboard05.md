* Part of your broader professional development.

Quick introductions
-------------------

* Introduce yourselves to your teammates.

Team résumé reviews
---------------------

* Read your peers' résumés.
* Discuss the following issues:
    * If I knew nothing else about this person, what would I think about
      how they would contribute to my team?
    * What is something I'd like to adapt from their résumé?
    * What is something they should change on their résumé?
* Plan to finish by about 3:35.

Group debrief
-------------

Note

* It can be hard to look at these and say "I don't look as good
  on paper."
* But you are all great.
* Disclaimer: There's a lot of disagreement about what makes a
  good technical resume.

What did you learn?

* LaTeX can make pretty resumes.
* "Wow, this person claims to be technical but they don't know
  how to separate their technical and non-technical experience."
    * Think about different resumes for different situations
    * Not everything needs to be on your resume.
* People perceive me differently from my resume than I would
  want to be perceived.
* Legibility is important.
* How do you show off important things like leadership when
  they come from non-technical experiences.
