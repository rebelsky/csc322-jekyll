CSC 322.01, Class 05:  Team building
====================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries
    * Notes and news
    * Upcoming work
    * Extra credit
    * Questions
* Team building exercises

### Admin

* Our goal for today is to help build teams.
* Fill out the Dudle (long u) poll.  You *will* need help.  Make sure
  that KY is available at a time that is good for you.
 
### Upcoming work

* Make an appointment to meet with your community partner.  Contact
  Susan Sanning if you need contact info.  Plan to meet with your
  community partner some time next week, if possible.
    * Ideally, it's the whole team.
    * Since that's often next-to-impossible, a part of the team is okay.
    * You may use 10am-11am TuTh for the meeting time.
* If you are working on an existing project, find it in the CSC 322
  organization, make a clone, and try to get it running.
    * You may have to track down others to help.
* If you are working on a new project, get it set up in the CSC 322
  organization.  (A blank Rails thing is fine.)

### Good things to do

#### Academic

* Rosenfield symposium, this week.  (Lots of different events)

#### Misc

* Les Duke
* Sign up for picnic (see email)

### Questions

Team Building Exercises
-----------------------

* Share resumes with each other (and with me and with Kathryn).
* Read each other's resumes.
* If this was all you saw about the person, what would you expect about
  the person joining your team?

Sam turns mean(er).

* This person did not bring their resume to the exercise.  They are 
  never going to get work on time.
* This person used Word and doesn't know how to align things.  They 
  are probably an IT major rather than a CS major.  And they're not
  even a good IT major.
* This person listed HTML as a programming language.  They are an IT
  major, and don't really know how to program.
* This person used the most popular LaTeX resume format.  I have no
  idea whether or not they know LaTeX, but they are able to hack
  together things.
* This person did not format their stuff consistently.  I will never let
  them touch my code.
* This person used underlines to emphasize things.  They know nothing
  about typography.
* This person lists no technical skills on their resume.  'nuff said.
* This person's resume does not fit on a page.
* This person does not use grammatically correct English.  (I'll let you
  fill in your own implications.
* This person is an anthropologist.  I wonder if they are studying us.
* This person used buzzwords that I don't know.  They are likely to be
  arrogant and a poor communicator.
