### Questions

Background
----------

* You are going to be some subset of computer scientist, software developer,
  computer professional, coder, SWE
* The word "profession" is associated with many of these roles.
* The concept "profession" suggests something about responsibilities to
  society.
    * Physicians: "Do no harm"
    * Lawyers: ...
    * Engineers: ...
* The computing professional societies (ACM and IEEE Comp. Soc.)
  suggested that, no matter what we call ourselves, we have some
  associated resopnsibilities.
* Even if none of that were true, the Grinnell CS department believes
  that you have a responsibility to think about the impact of the work
  yo do.
* We address this belief in multiple ways
    * Raise issues in classes
    * CS table
    * This course
    * CSC 151 - we hope
* We will
    * reflect on the ACM code of ethics
    * consider a variety of other issues
    * explore some of the underlying ethical frameworks upon which
      the code is built

Key responsibilities
--------------------

"Computer scientists clearly care about their responsibilities to the
broader world.   In particular, our code of ethics says that we should ..."

_Pick three things that you would highlight._

* "Duh, these are obvious.  Of course I avoid harm to others and do
  my job well."
    * The details of what that means are important.
    * Having it in writing means that you can garner support when you
      want to challenge an action.
    * Having it in writing provides you with ammunition when you
      confront a less ethical supervisor.
* We have experienced these issues in our projects.
* It's hard.
