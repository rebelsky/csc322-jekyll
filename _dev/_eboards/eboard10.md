Meet Megan Goering
------------------

    * Anyone can teach it given the tools.
* Design thinking is a toolkit for product development and product
  design.  
* Came from collaboration of multiple departments at Stanford (Art,
  Engineering, etc.)
* You can use it create things that are not products.  Processes,
  Policies, Protests, etc.
* Supposed to be empowered to use what seem like stopping points as
  things to work creatively around.
