On the first Monday of each sprint, you present on work accomplished during
the previous sprint and your plans for the coming sprint.  On the second
Monday of each sprint, you do a quick demonstration (a.k.a. "Dog and Pony show")
to demonstrate the status of your system.

It may seem odd to do a demonstration in the middle of a sprint.  Our demos
will usually involve work completed in the last sprint.  (You should normally
be working on a safe branch during the sprint in any case.)
