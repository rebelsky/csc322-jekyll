As you may have noted, we are breaking our course up into (mostly) two-week
sprints.  In class on the first day of each sprint, each group will give a
short report on their project.  A typical report will include a list of 
tasks accomplished (and not accomplished), a project velocity, and a list
of planned tasks for the coming sprint.

This week is your first presentation.  You will be responsible for giving
a short description of your project, the state of the code you've inherited
(e.g., "We can't get it running yet" or "It does A, B, and C, but not D"),
and a list of tasks and point values for the coming sprint.
